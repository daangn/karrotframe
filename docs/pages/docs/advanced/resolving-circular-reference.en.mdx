# Resolving Circular References with useFlow

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  You can easily resolve the `useFlow()` circular reference issue by using the [Future API](/api-references/future-api/introduction). We recommend using the [Future API](/api-references/future-api/introduction).
</Callout>

The `useFlow()` function returned by the `stackflow()` function utilizes the declared activity types. Therefore, `useFlow()` and activity components interlock, causing a circular dependency. By using the `useActions()` hook and importing the types separately, you can eliminate this circular dependency.

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="stackflow.ts" copy
import { stackflow } from "@stackflow/react";

export const { Stack, activities } = stackflow({
  activities: {
    // ...
  },
  // ...
});

// Expose the type of activities like this.
export type TypeActivities = typeof activities;
```

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="stackflow.ts" copy
import { useActions } from "@stackflow/react";

// Only import the exposed activity type.
import type { TypeActivities } from "./stackflow";

export const useMyFlow = () => {
  return useActions<TypeActivities>();
};
```

<Callout emoji="⚡️">
  `TypeActivities` will be similarly utilized in future utility components/hooks.
</Callout>
