# Stackflow Future API

- We are revamping Stackflow's interface to optimize initial loading performance.
- Adding support for a Loader API without React dependency.

## Future API?

- The Future API is a preview version of Stackflow 2.0 API.
- Since it is not a finalized API, your feedback on any inconveniences you encounter while using it is highly appreciated and can contribute to further improvements.
- The existing API can still be used as the internal workings remain unchanged. However, the existing API will be removed after the 2.0 version update.

### Minimum Package Version

To use the newly added Future API, please update the following packages to the latest version.

- `@stackflow/config`
- `@stackflow/core`
- `@stackflow/react`
- `@stackflow/plugin-history-sync`
- (Optional) `@stackflow/link`

<Callout type="warning">
  The Future API may have partial changes in the API. If you find any discrepancies with the documentation while using it, please ensure you are using the latest version.
