# `@stackflow/config`

### Config

- Introduce the concept of `Config` in Stackflow.
- Allows static declaration of activities without React dependency.

You can write as follows.

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="stackflow.config.ts" copy
import { defineConfig } from "@stackflow/config";

export const config = defineConfig({
  activities: [
    {
      name: "HomeActivity",
    },
    {
      name: "MyProfileActivity",
    }
  ],
  transitionDuration: 270,
});
```

  Now, when additional configuration is needed in a plugin, you can extend `@stackflow/config` to receive the necessary information for the plugin's operation, not just through the plugin function's parameters.
</Callout>

### `decorate` API

You can extend the `Config` type as follows to utilize `config` in various places.

```typescript
declare module "@stackflow/config" {
  interface Config {
    relayEnvironment: RelayEnvironment;
  }
}

config.decorate("relayEnvironment", myRelayEnvironment);
```
